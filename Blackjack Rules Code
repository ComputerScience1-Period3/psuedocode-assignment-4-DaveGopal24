Blackjack - Aaron Pandian

Requirements:
1 deck of cards containing 52 cards (excluding jokers), 1 or more players

How to play (insturctions): 
The player to the left of the dealer goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (stay with your cards) or "hit" 
(ask for another card). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for
additional cards, one at a time, until he either decides to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), goes "bust" (if it is over 21),
or gets exactly 21  in which case he wins, unless another player does the same. face cards equal 10, number cards equal thier number and 
aces have a vaule of 11.

Instuctions Sequence:
1. Dealer deals 2 cards to everybody
2. Look over your cards and if the cards equal 21 say blackjack
3. If the cards recieved don't equal 21 but are above a combined value of 17;
      Then say "stand" and wait until the opponents are done with their turns.
       If all the players complete their turns;
              Then show your cards to the other players. 
4. If your cards didn't even reach a value 17 
      Then say "hit" 
5. If the combined value of the 3 cards are above 17 
      Then say "stand" and wait until the opponents are done with their turns.
        If all the players complete their turns;
              Then show your cards to the other players.  
6. If the combibed value of the 3 cards isnt equal to 21;
      Then continue the process of saying "hit" until you have a combine valued of 17-21. You should have a total of 11 cards or less. 
7. If the combined value of your cards at any point exceed 21 then say "bust," meaning you have lost and must wait till the next round.

Instuctions Selection:
Once you recived the 2 cards from the dealer look over them
  If the 2 cards have a vaule equal to 21; 
    Then say "blackjack", then show your cards
  Else If the 2 cards dont equal 21 and are equal to or over 17 but under 21 
    Then say "stand" and place your cards on the table till everybody is done, then show your cards
  Else the 2 cards equal a value less than 17
    Then say "hit" and you will recive another card
      If the value of your 3 cards is less than 17;
        Then say "hit" until a value over 17 at the max ou should have 11 cards.
          If your cards value are over 17 and under 21;
            Then place your cards face down and wait till everybody is done, then show your cards
        Else If: you went over the value of 21
            Say "bust" and wait for the next round
