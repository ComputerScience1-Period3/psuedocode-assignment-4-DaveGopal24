Blackjack - Aaron Pandian

How to play: The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (stay with your cards) or "hit" 
(ask for another card). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for
additional cards, one at a time, until he either decides to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), goes "bust" (if it is over 21),
or gets exactly 21  in which case he wins, unless another player does the same.

Sequence:
Once you recived the 2 cards from the dealer look over them
  If the 2 cards have a vaule equal to 21- 
    Say "stand" and place your cards on the table till everybody is done, then show your cards.
  If the 2 cards dont equal 21 and are equal to or over 17 but under 21- 
    Say "stand" and place your cards on the table till everybody is done, then show your cards.
  If the 2 cards equal a value less than 17-
    Say "hit" and you will recive another card
      If the value of your 3 cards is still less than 17-
        Say "hit" until you have a value over 17-
          If your cards value are over 17 and under 21 then place your cards down and wait till everybody is done, then show your cards.
          If not then you went over the value of 21, say "bust" and wait for the next round.
